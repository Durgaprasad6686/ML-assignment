This repository contains a tutorial on *Hierarchical Clustering*, a powerful unsupervised learning method used to group data into clusters using a tree-like structure (dendrogram).
The notebook demonstrates the theory, implementation, and visualization of hierarchical clustering on real-world datasets using Python.
